## Project Description

The Foundry Smart Contract Lottery solves the fundamental problem of trust in traditional lottery systems. Traditional lotteries are centralized and opaque - users cannot verify the randomness and fairness of draws, and must trust administrators.

This smart contract implements a fully on-chain lottery with:

- **Verifiable Randomness**: Uses Chainlink VRF to ensure tamper-proof random winner selection
- **Automated Operations**: Chainlink Automation triggers draws at fixed intervals without human intervention
- **Complete Transparency**: All operations are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Fair Distribution**: 100% of the prize pool goes to the winner with no fees deducted
- **Immutable Rules**: Entry fees and draw intervals are fixed at deployment and cannot be changed

Players pay a configurable entry fee to join lottery rounds. When the predetermined time interval elapses and participants have entered, the system automatically requests verifiable randomness, selects a winner, distributes the entire prize pool, and resets for the next round.

## Tech Stack

### Core Development
- **Foundry**: Blazing fast Ethereum development toolkit
  - **Forge**: Testing framework and deployment tool
  - **Cast**: Command-line tool for interacting with Ethereum
  - **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node for development
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language

### External Services
- **Chainlink VRF v2**: Verifiable random function for fair winner selection
- **Chainlink Automation**: Decentralized automation for scheduled draws

### Quality Assurance & Security
- **Slither**: Static analysis tool for security vulnerability detection
- **Solhint**: Solidity linter for code quality and best practices
- **Prettier**: Code formatter with Solidity support

### Deployment & CI/CD
- **Forge Script**: Deployment automation and management
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration and deployment pipeline

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-f23
cd foundry-smart-contract-lottery-f23
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
forge install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
forge build
```

4. Run tests to verify setup:
```bash
forge test
```

### Local Development

Start a local Ethereum node:
```bash
anvil
```

Deploy to local network:
```bash
forge script script/Counter.s.sol:CounterScript --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key <your_private_key>
```

## Available Scripts

### Build
Compile the smart contracts:
```bash
forge build
```

### Test
Run the test suite:
```bash
forge test
```

Run tests with verbosity:
```bash
forge test -vvv
```

### Format
Format code according to style guidelines:
```bash
forge fmt
```

### Gas Analysis
Generate gas usage snapshots:
```bash
forge snapshot
```

### Security Analysis
Run static security analysis:
```bash
slither .
```

### Linting
Check code quality and style:
```bash
solhint 'src/**/*.sol'
```

### Deploy
Deploy to Sepolia testnet:
```bash
forge script script/Counter.s.sol:CounterScript --rpc-url <sepolia_rpc_url> --private-key <your_private_key> --verify
```

### Interact with Contract
Use Cast for on-chain interactions:
```bash
cast <subcommand>
```

## Project Scope

### In Scope ‚úÖ
