## Project Description

The Foundry Smart Contract Lottery solves the fundamental problem of trust in traditional lottery systems. Traditional lotteries are centralized and opaque - users cannot verify the randomness and fairness of draws, and must trust administrators.

This smart contract implements a fully on-chain lottery with:

- **Verifiable Randomness**: Uses Chainlink VRF to ensure tamper-proof random winner selection
- **Automated Operations**: Chainlink Automation triggers draws at fixed intervals without human intervention
- **Complete Transparency**: All operations are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Fair Distribution**: 100% of the prize pool goes to the winner with no fees deducted
- **Immutable Rules**: Entry fees and draw intervals are fixed at deployment and cannot be changed

Players pay a configurable entry fee to join lottery rounds. When the predetermined time interval elapses and participants have entered, the system automatically requests verifiable randomness, selects a winner, distributes the entire prize pool, and resets for the next round.

## Deployment Environments

This project supports deployment to multiple environments, each optimized for different stages of development:

### Environment Overview

| Environment | Purpose | Network | Cost | Verification |
|------------|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| **Local** | Development & Testing | Anvil | Free | Not needed |
| **Testnet** | Integration Testing | Sepolia | Testnet ETH | Etherscan |
| **Mainnet** | Production | Ethereum | Real ETH | Etherscan |

## Local Environment (Anvil)

**Use Case**: Rapid development, testing, and debugging

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
- No API keys required
- No external ETH needed

### Setup

1. **Start Anvil to see available accounts:**
   ```bash
   anvil
   # Displays 10 pre-funded accounts with their private keys
   ```

2. **Import one of Anvil's accounts into keystore:**
   ```bash
   cast wallet import localKey --interactive
   # When prompted, use any private key from the Anvil output above
   # Set a password for encryption
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Start Anvil:**
   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

2. **Deploy contract:**
   ```bash
   make deploy-local
   ```

### Features
- 10 pre-funded accounts (10,000 ETH each)
- Instant block mining and transaction processing
- No gas costs
- State resets when Anvil restarts
- Rich debugging information

## Available Scripts

### Build
Compile the smart contracts:
```bash
forge build
```

### Test
Run the test suite:
```bash
forge test
```

Run tests with verbosity:
```bash
forge test -vvv
```

### Format
Format code according to style guidelines:
```bash
forge fmt
```

### Gas Analysis
Generate gas usage snapshots:
```bash
forge snapshot
```

### Security Analysis
Run static security analysis:
```bash
slither .
```

### Linting
Check code quality and style:
```bash
solhint 'src/**/*.sol'
```

## Testnet Environment (Sepolia)

**Use Case**: Integration testing with real network conditions

### Prerequisites

1. **API Keys:**
   - [Alchemy API Key](https://alchemy.com) for RPC endpoint
   - [Etherscan API Key](https://etherscan.io/apis) for verification

2. **Testnet ETH:**
   - Get from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
   - Minimum ~0.01 ETH needed for deployment

### Setup

1. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your API keys:
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Set up keystore account:**
   ```bash
   cast wallet import sepoliaKey --interactive
   # Enter your private key (without 0x prefix)
   # Set a password for encryption
   ```

### Deployment

```bash
make deploy-sepolia
```

This will:
- Deploy with default parameters (0.01 ETH entry, 30s interval)
- Automatically verify on Etherscan
- Provide contract address and verification URL

### Features
- Real network conditions and gas costs
- Etherscan verification and monitoring
- Persistent state (doesn't reset)
- Public testnet accessibility
