Contract deployment infrastructure is fully operational across both local and testnet environments.

## Current Status

• ✅ Successfully deployed contract to Sepolia testnet with verified functionality
• ✅ Manually tested complete raffle flow using cast: enter raffle, pick winner, transfer prize
• ✅ Resolved deployment authentication issues with keystore configuration
• ✅ Cleaned up repository by removing Foundry template files (Counter contracts)
• ✅ Updated deployment script with realistic 5-minute testing interval

## Next Tasks

• Create integration tests like here https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/foundry-fund-me/solidity-integration-tests
• Create automated interaction scripts to replace manual cast commands
• Implement multi-player raffle scenarios for realistic testing
• Build operator interaction script for streamlined winner selection process
• Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

## Important Reminders

• Contract has been successfully tested end-to-end on Sepolia testnet
• Security vulnerabilities (4/10 score) remain and should be addressed before mainnet deployment

# Session Notes - September 01, 2025

## Feature Summary

Enhanced the walking skeleton deployment infrastructure with comprehensive multi-environment support. Successfully implemented secure keystore-based deployment for both local development (Anvil) and testnet (Sepolia), with environment-organized documentation and security best practices.

## Current Status

• ✅ Enhanced deployment infrastructure with multi-environment support (Local/Testnet/Mainnet)
• ✅ Successfully deployed and tested on both Anvil local network and Sepolia testnet
• ✅ Implemented secure keystore authentication removing hardcoded private keys and addresses
• ✅ Restructured README with comprehensive environment-based deployment instructions
• ✅ Added make deploy-local command and updated Makefile with proper help documentation
• ✅ Cleaned up foundry.toml and .env.example following security best practices

## Next Tasks

• Create operator interaction script for manual winner selection testing
• Test complete end-to-end flow: deploy → enter → pick winner → verify on Etherscan
• Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
• Consider implementing pull payment security fixes from previous audit

## Important Reminders

• Walking skeleton deployment infrastructure now complete with both local and testnet support
• Contract still has critical security vulnerabilities (4/10 score) that should be addressed before mainnet
• Documentation follows security best practices with no private keys exposed

# Session Notes - August 28, 2025

## Feature Summary

Implemented complete walking skeleton deployment infrastructure for the Raffle smart contract. Successfully deployed to Sepolia testnet with end-to-end verification, creating a fully functional deployment pipeline from development to live blockchain.

## Current Status

• ✅ Created DeployRaffle.s.sol script with configurable parameters (entrance fee, interval)
• ✅ Configured foundry.toml with Sepolia network configuration and Etherscan verification
• ✅ Added .env.example for environment variable documentation and security
• ✅ Built Makefile with simplified deployment commands (make deploy-sepolia)
• ✅ Successfully deployed to Sepolia: 0x2Abae9E6a5C229458a9d9a8c056b62C5A701D243
• ✅ Contract verified on Etherscan with source code visibility

## Next Tasks

• Create operator interaction script for manual winner selection testing
• Test complete end-to-end flow: deploy → enter → pick winner → verify on Etherscan
• Add deployment instructions to README for team collaboration
• Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
• Consider implementing pull payment security fixes before mainnet deployment

## Important Reminders

• Walking skeleton now complete - contract deployed and verified on Sepolia testnet
• Contract has critical security vulnerabilities (4/10 score) from previous audit that should be addressed
• broadcast/ directory contains sensitive deployment data and should not be committed to git

# Session Notes - August 27, 2025

## Feature Summary

Conducted comprehensive security audit of the Raffle.sol smart contract and identified critical vulnerabilities. Contract received 4/10 security score with issues including weak randomness, fund lock risks, reentrancy vulnerabilities, and gas limit DoS attacks. Explored pull payment solution as comprehensive fix for multiple security issues.

## Current Status

• ✅ Completed gas optimization with mapping-based player lookup (O(1) vs O(n))
• ✅ Added `s_playersInRaffle` mapping and `_addPlayerToRaffle()` helper function
• ✅ Performed comprehensive security audit identifying 5 critical/high severity vulnerabilities
• ✅ Analyzed pull payment pattern as solution for reentrancy (Point 4) and fund lock (Point 2) risks
• ✅ Confirmed pull payment approach provides secure two-step winner experience (win → claim)

## Next Tasks

• Configure contract deployment to testnet environment
• Test contract functionality on real network with actual ETH transactions
• Validate gas costs and user experience in live environment
• Consider implementing pull payment security fixes before mainnet deployment
• Set up deployment scripts and network configuration for testnet testing

## Important Reminders

• Contract has critical security vulnerabilities (4/10 score) that should be addressed before mainnet
• Pull payment pattern eliminates both reentrancy risk AND permanent fund lock simultaneously
• Frontend will need "Claim Prize" functionality when pull payment is implemented

# Session Notes - August 26, 2025

## Feature Summary

Working through code review recommendations to improve the smart contract lottery project. Successfully implemented constructor validation for entrance fee and interval parameters using TDD methodology. Next focus is gas optimization for inefficient player lookup functionality.

## Current Status

• ✅ Completed constructor validation (Recommended Action Item #3)
• ✅ Added `Raffle__InvalidEntranceFee` and `Raffle__InvalidInterval` error handling
• ✅ All 23 tests passing with proper TDD implementation
• ✅ Contract now prevents deployment with invalid parameters (entranceFee = 0 or interval = 0)
• ✅ Confirmed function ordering in Raffle.sol is already compliant with CLAUDE.md conventions

## Next Tasks

• Implement gas optimization for player lookup in `isPlayerInRaffle()` function
• Replace linear array search (O(n)) with mapping-based lookup (O(1))
• Add `mapping(address => bool) private s_isPlayerInRaffle` for efficient player tracking
• Follow TDD process: write failing tests → implement minimal solution → refactor
• Update player entry/exit logic to maintain mapping consistency

## Important Reminders

• Current inefficient code at `src/Raffle.sol:71-77` uses linear search through `s_players` array
• Gas costs grow linearly with number of players - could become expensive with many participants
• Must maintain both array (for winner selection) and mapping (for lookup) data structures
