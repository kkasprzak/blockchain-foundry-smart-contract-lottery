# Session Notes - August 27, 2025

## Feature Summary
Conducted comprehensive security audit of the Raffle.sol smart contract and identified critical vulnerabilities. Contract received 4/10 security score with issues including weak randomness, fund lock risks, reentrancy vulnerabilities, and gas limit DoS attacks. Explored pull payment solution as comprehensive fix for multiple security issues.

## Current Status
• ✅ Completed gas optimization with mapping-based player lookup (O(1) vs O(n))
• ✅ Added `s_playersInRaffle` mapping and `_addPlayerToRaffle()` helper function
• ✅ Performed comprehensive security audit identifying 5 critical/high severity vulnerabilities
• ✅ Analyzed pull payment pattern as solution for reentrancy (Point 4) and fund lock (Point 2) risks
• ✅ Confirmed pull payment approach provides secure two-step winner experience (win → claim)

## Next Tasks
• Configure contract deployment to testnet environment
• Test contract functionality on real network with actual ETH transactions
• Validate gas costs and user experience in live environment
• Consider implementing pull payment security fixes before mainnet deployment
• Set up deployment scripts and network configuration for testnet testing

## Important Reminders
• Contract has critical security vulnerabilities (4/10 score) that should be addressed before mainnet
• Pull payment pattern eliminates both reentrancy risk AND permanent fund lock simultaneously
• Frontend will need "Claim Prize" functionality when pull payment is implemented

# Session Notes - August 26, 2025

## Feature Summary
Working through code review recommendations to improve the smart contract lottery project. Successfully implemented constructor validation for entrance fee and interval parameters using TDD methodology. Next focus is gas optimization for inefficient player lookup functionality.

## Current Status
• ✅ Completed constructor validation (Recommended Action Item #3)
• ✅ Added `Raffle__InvalidEntranceFee` and `Raffle__InvalidInterval` error handling
• ✅ All 23 tests passing with proper TDD implementation
• ✅ Contract now prevents deployment with invalid parameters (entranceFee = 0 or interval = 0)
• ✅ Confirmed function ordering in Raffle.sol is already compliant with CLAUDE.md conventions

## Next Tasks
• Implement gas optimization for player lookup in `isPlayerInRaffle()` function
• Replace linear array search (O(n)) with mapping-based lookup (O(1))
• Add `mapping(address => bool) private s_isPlayerInRaffle` for efficient player tracking
• Follow TDD process: write failing tests → implement minimal solution → refactor
• Update player entry/exit logic to maintain mapping consistency

## Important Reminders
• Current inefficient code at `src/Raffle.sol:71-77` uses linear search through `s_players` array
• Gas costs grow linearly with number of players - could become expensive with many participants
• Must maintain both array (for winner selection) and mapping (for lookup) data structures

Previous Session (2025-01-15):
**Transaction Revert Vulnerability** was identified and fixed - malicious winner contracts could cause permanent raffle failure by reverting ETH transfers.
