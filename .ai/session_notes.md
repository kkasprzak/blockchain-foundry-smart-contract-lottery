# Session Notes - August 26, 2025

## Feature Summary
Working through code review recommendations to improve the smart contract lottery project. Successfully implemented constructor validation for entrance fee and interval parameters using TDD methodology. Next focus is gas optimization for inefficient player lookup functionality.

## Current Status
• ✅ Completed constructor validation (Recommended Action Item #3)
• ✅ Added `Raffle__InvalidEntranceFee` and `Raffle__InvalidInterval` error handling
• ✅ All 23 tests passing with proper TDD implementation
• ✅ Contract now prevents deployment with invalid parameters (entranceFee = 0 or interval = 0)
• ✅ Confirmed function ordering in Raffle.sol is already compliant with CLAUDE.md conventions

## Next Tasks
• Implement gas optimization for player lookup in `isPlayerInRaffle()` function
• Replace linear array search (O(n)) with mapping-based lookup (O(1))
• Add `mapping(address => bool) private s_isPlayerInRaffle` for efficient player tracking
• Follow TDD process: write failing tests → implement minimal solution → refactor
• Update player entry/exit logic to maintain mapping consistency

## Important Reminders
• Current inefficient code at `src/Raffle.sol:71-77` uses linear search through `s_players` array
• Gas costs grow linearly with number of players - could become expensive with many participants
• Must maintain both array (for winner selection) and mapping (for lookup) data structures

**Transaction Revert Vulnerability** was identified and fixed - malicious winner contracts could cause permanent raffle failure by reverting ETH transfers.
