# Session Notes - 2025-01-15

## Feature Summary
Discovered and analyzed a critical **Transaction Revert Vulnerability** in the `pickWinner()` method. While the method follows proper Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and blocks traditional reentrancy attacks via access control, malicious winner contracts can cause permanent raffle failure by reverting ETH transfers, which rolls back all state changes including participant clearing.

## Current Status
• ✅ Code cleanup completed - removed unused `RevertingWinner` contract and `Raffle__NoParticipants` error
• ✅ US-003 no-participants behavior implemented - `pickWinner()` resets entry window when no participants  
• ✅ All 19 tests passing after recent changes
• ✅ Security vulnerability identified and analyzed in detail
• ✅ PRD updated with corrected acceptance criteria for US-003

## Next Tasks
• **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix Transaction Revert Vulnerability in `pickWinner()` method
• Write failing test to demonstrate malicious winner contract attack vector
• Implement solution: remove `require(success, "Prize transfer failed")` or use better error handling
• Consider additional protection layers (ReentrancyGuard, event logging for failed transfers)
• Verify fix prevents raffle from getting permanently stuck

## Important Reminders
• **Attack Vector**: Malicious winner contracts can revert `receive()` causing `require(success, ...)` to revert entire transaction, rolling back `_resetRaffleForNextRound()` and creating infinite loop
• **Key Insight**: This is NOT traditional reentrancy (blocked by operator access control) but transaction revert causing state rollback vulnerability
• **Core Problem**: `require(success, "Prize transfer failed")` treats failed transfers as fatal errors instead of handling gracefully
